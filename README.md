# Java-CIT239-Final-Project
About the Final Project
Your final project must have:

A JavaFX class that extends Application
Abstract base class and two subclasses that extend the abstract class
An unrelated "utility" class that is used by the classes above (e.g. a Dice class)
GUI to build (set attributes of) the base classes with the ability to alter and change the setup.  If you use color, or similar, you MUST use an object (NOT TEXT)
The following Interfaces: Serializable, Comparable
A class that throws an exception, and another that has a try/catch/finally block that uses that exception
a Menu that at minimum allows the user to save a *BINARY* file and open an existing file that stored the status objects
JavaDocs & UMLs for each class.
